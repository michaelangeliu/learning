    ```
- Install libraries by adding them to the Cargo.toml file under dependencies. e.g.
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    rand = "0.8.5"
    ```
- Cargo.lock ensures reproducible builds 
- Build documentation for all dependencies locally
    ```shell
    cargo doc --open
    ```

## Common Programming Concepts

### Variables and Mutability

- `let` allows the declaration of a immutable variable
- `let mut` allows the declaration of a mutable variable 
- `const` allows the declaration of a value that is allways immutable
    - the type _must_ be annotated
    - may only be set to a constant expression
        - cannot be set to a value that is computed at runtime
    - __BY CONVENTION__ - all uppercase with underscores between words
- shadowing variables
    - first variable is shadowed by the second and the second
    - repeated use of `let` and the same variable name
    - `let` is important because the variable is still immutable
    - shadowing allows the type of the variable can change
        ```rust
        // valid
        let spaces = "   "; // string
        let spaces = spaces.len(); // number

        // compile time error
        let mut spaces = "   "; // string
        spaces = spaces.len(); // number
        ```
        - avoids different names like `spaces_str` and `spaces_num`

### Data Types

#### Scalar

- Integer
    - signed/unsigned numbers in [two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement)
    - e.g. `i32`, `u32`
    - `isize` and `usize` depends on the archtecture the computer is running on
        - e.g. 64 bits if on a 64-bit archtecture
    - `i32` is a good default integer size generally
    - Can use `_` as a visual separator
        e.g. `1_000` is equivalent to `1000`
    - integer overflow can cause the program to panic
        - when debugging, the compiler will check
        - the `--release` flag will skip overflow checks and use _two's complement wrapping_
            - relying on wrapping is considered an error
        - Explicit handling by:
            - Wrap in all modes with the `wrapping_*` methods, such as `wrapping_add`.
            - Return the None value if there is overflow with the `checked_*` methods.
            - Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the `overflowing_*` methods.
            - Saturate at the valueâ€™s minimum or maximum values with the `saturating_*` methods.
- Floating-point
    - `f32` and `f64`
        `f32` is single-precision flooat
        `f64` is double-precision flooat
    - `f64` is default due to increased precision and the assumption that it's running on modern CPUs
    - IEEE-754 standard
- Numeric Operations
    - `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`,
    - integer division truncates toward zero to the nearest integer
        - e.g. (`-5/3 === -1` and `5/3 === 1`)
- Booleans
    - `bool` keyword
    - 1 byte in size
        i.e. `00000000` or `11111111`
- Characters
    - `char` keyword
    - 4 bytes
        - uses Unicode Scalar Values from `U+0000` to `U+D7FF` and `U+E000` to `U+10FFFF` inclusive
    - specified with single quotes, as opposed to double quotes, which use double quotes.

#### Compound Types

- Tuple
    - Group a number of values with a variety of types together
    - fixed length, cannot grow or shrink
    - comma-separated list of values inside parentheses
    - each position in the tuple has a type, but can be different
    - Can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value
        ```rust
        fn main() {
            let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

            let (x, y, z) = tup;

            println!("The value of y is: {y}");
        }
        ```
    - or with indexes
        ```rust
        fn main() {
            let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

            let five_hundred = x.0;

            let six_point_four = x.1;

            let one = x.2;
        }
        ```
    - _unit_ is a special name ofr a tuple without any values and represents an empty value or an empty return type
        - expresssions implicitly return the _unit_ vavlue if they dont' return any other value
- Array
    - collection of values with the same type
    - fixed length, cannot grow or shrink
    - comma separated list of values inside square brackets
    - stored in a stack, rather than a heap, in memory
    - examples
        ```rust
        let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // type can be specified like so:

        let b: [3; 5]; // equivalent to [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
        ```
    - access with squqare brackets and indexes
        - invalid index access will cause the app to panic

### Functions

- snake_case is the conventional style for function and variable names
- `fn` is the function definition keyword

#### Parameters

- special variables that are part of a function's signature
- `arguments` are the concrete values that are provided to a function
- function signatures require parameter type annotations to allow it to give a more helpful error message

#### Statements and Expressions

- function bodies are made up of a series of statements, optionally ending in an expression
    - __Statements__ are instructions that perform somea ction and do not return a value
    - __Expressions__ evaluate to a resultant value
        ```rust
        fn main() {
            let y = {
                let x = 3;
                x + 1
            };

            println!("The value of y is: {y}");
        }
        ```
        - Note the lack of a semicolon. Adding a semicolon to the end of an expression turns it into a statement and it will not return a value.

#### Functions with Return Values

- declare function return value type after an arrow (`->`).
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let x = plus_one(5);

        println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    }

    fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
        x + 1
    }
    ```
    vs.
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let x = plus_one(5);

        println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    }

    fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
        x + 1; // This semi-colon means its a statement and returns the unit type (), which contradicts the return value annotation
    }
    ```

### Comments

- `//` is the standard single line comment.
- Sometimes at the end of lines, but more typically used as annotation on a separate line above the code.

### Control Flow

#### `if` expressions

- start with `if` keyword, foollowed by an expression.
- blocks of code are placed in curly braces
    - sometimes called _arms_, like the `match`
- `else` is optional
- will not automatically try to convert non-Boolea types to a Boolean.
- multiple conditions with `else if`.
- `if` is an expression, so it can be used to assign variables (i.e. ternary assignment)
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let condition = true;
        let number i= if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

        println!("The value of number is: {number}");
    }
    ```
    - Since they are expressions, the return types cannot be mismatched, or else ther eis an error.

#### Repetition with Loops

- `loop`
    - repeats forever until quit
        - `ctrl-c` can quit
        - `break` will exit the loop
            - Including the value after the `break` will return that value from the loop
        - `continue` skips the remaining code to go to the next iteration
    - `break`/`continue`
        - applies to the inner most loop, if there are multiple
    - loops can be labeled which can be used with `break`/`continue`
        ```rust
        fn main() {
            let mut count = 0;
            'counting_up: loop {
                println!("count = {count}");
                let mut remaining = 10;

                loop {
                    println!("remaining = {remaining}");
                    if remaining == 9 {
                        break;
                    }
                    if count == 2 {
                        break 'counting_up;
                    }
                    remaining -= 1;
                }

                count += 1;
            }
            println!("End count = {count}");
        }
        ```
- `while`
    - Handles some of the nesting that would be necessary if you used `loop`, `if`, `else`, `break`.
- `for`
    - most commonly used for increase safety/conciseness.
    - can avoid an out of index exception when looping through arrays or for a certain number of times using `Range`
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
        let mut index = 0;

        while index < 5 { { // changing this to 6 would cause the code to panic when accessing a[6].
            println!("the value is {}", a[index]);

            index += 1;
        }}

        for number in (1..4).rev() {
            println!("{number}!");
        }
        println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
    }
    ```

## Understanding Ownership

### Stack & Heap memory

- Stack
    - LIFO = Last In, First Out
        - push & pop onto the stack
    - must have a known szie
- Heap
    - returns a pointer to the address of the allocated space
    - allocate/deallocate memory
- pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the allocator never has to search for a place to store new data.
- allocating space on the heap requires more work because the allocator must first find a big enough space to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next allocation.
- accessing data in the heap is slower than on the stack because you must follow a pointer

### Ownership Rules

- each value in Rust has an _owner_.
- there can only be one owner at a time.
when the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

### Variable Scope

#### The String Type

- allocated onto the heap
- can be created using a string literally using the `from` function
    ```rust
    let s = String::from("hello");
    ```
- When a variable goes out of scope, it will call a special function called `drop` to return the memory
    - In C++, this pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item's lifetime is sometimes called _Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)_.
- Simple vs. complex values
    ```rust
    let x = 5; // stores 5 into memory
    let y = x; // stores 5 into memory

    // vs.

    let s1 = String::from("hello"); // adds the meta-data/pointer and also stores the string contents
    let s2 = s1; // essentially copies the meta data, but does not copy the heap that the pointer refers to. Copying the heap memory could make it very expensive
    ```
    - a String is made of three parts
        - `ptr` = points at the memory that holds the string contents
        - `len` = length of the string
        - `capacity` = total space allocated
    - when `s2` and `s1` both go out of scope, both will try to free the same heap memory (_double free_ error).
    ```rust
        let s1 = String::from("hello");
        let s2 = s1;

        println!("{}, world!", s1); // compile error because Rust considers s1 no longer valid after the reassignment
    ```
- Rust will never automatically create "deep" copies of data, so _automatic_ copying is assumed to inexpensive
- `clone` will allow a "deep" copy
    ```rust
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone();

    println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);

    ```
- Rust has a special annotation called the `Copy` trait that we can place on types that are stored on the stack. If a type implements the `Copy` trait, variables that use it do not move, but rather are trivially copied, making them still valid after assignment to another variable.
    - If the type or any of its parts has implemented the `Drop` trait, it cannot be implemented with `Copy`
    - e.g.
        - integers
        - Booleans
        - floating points
        - chars
        - tuples if they only contain types that also implement `Copy`

#### Ownership and Functions

- Passing aa value to a function is similar to assigning a value to a variable
- will move/copy, just like an assignment
    - e.g.
        - passing a String will transfer ownership
        - passing an integer will make a copy
- returning the value will transfer ownership back if the value is assigned
- Could potentially be tedious by using tuples to return multiple values:
    - e.g. this scenario where we want to use both the string and the length
        ```rust
        fn main() {
            let s1 = String::from("hello");

            let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

            println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s2, len);
        }

        fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
            let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String

            (s, length)
        }
        ```
- _references_ allow using a value without transfering ownership

### References and Borrowing

- a reference is like a pointer that it's an address we can follow to access the data stored at that address; that data is owned by some other variable. Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type for the life of that reference
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let s1 = String::from("hello");

        let len = calculate_length(&s1);

        println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
    }

    fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
        s.len()
    }
    ```
    - no tuple code and they use `&` in both the argument and the function definition
        - `&` represents _references_, which allows values to be referenced without taking ownership of it.
- _borrowing_ = the act of creating a reference
- also immutable by default but we can create mutable references
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let mut s = String::from("hello");

        change(&mut s);
    }

    fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
        some_string.push_str(", world");
    }
    ```
    - cannot create multiple mutable __simultaneous__ references to a value
        - allows for mutation, but carefully
        - can prvent data races
            - e.g.
                - two or mre pointers access the same data at the same time
                - at least one of thpointers is being used towrite to the data
                - there's no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data
        - using a curly brace can create separate scopes to allow for multiple mutable references, just not _simultaneous_ ones
    - similar rule for combining mutable and immutable references

#### Dangling References

- _dangling pointer_ = pointer that references a location in memory that may have been given to someone else
```rust
fn dangle() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String

    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String

    &s // we return a reference to the String, s
} // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
  // Danger!
```
- Solution:
    ```rust
    fn no_dangle() -> String {
        let s = String::from("hello");

        s // return the string
    }
    ```

- The Rules of References
    - At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
    - References must always be valid.

### Slice Type

- A _string slice_ is a reference to part of a `String`
    ```rust
    let s = String::from("hello world");

    let hello = &s[0..5];
    let world = &s[6..11];
    ```
    - Just references a portion of a string using a starting and ending index
    - Ommitting the index means starting at either the beginning or end of the string
    - Avoids the value being freed when there are useless references to the size later.
- Swapping `&String` with `&str` increases the flexibility through _deref coercions_
    ```rust
    fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str { ... }
    // vs
    fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str { ... }
    ```
    - this is because `&str` is a slice pointing to a specific point of the binary data
- Arrays can also be sliced
    ```rust
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let slice = &a[1..3]; // type of &[i32]

    assert_eq!(slice, &[2, 3]);
    ```

## Structs

### Defining and Instantiating Structs

- Essentially JS objects
    ```rust
    struct User {
        active: bool,
        username: String,
        email: String,
        sign_in_count: u64,
    }

    // builds and returns a User struct with these properties. Reduces duplication of property names by using the same name as a shorthand
    fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
        User {
            active: true,
            username,
            email,
            sign_in_count: 1,
        }
    }
    ```
    - structs can be mutable, but the whole thing must be mutable to reassign any individual properties using dot notation.
- Struct update syntax allows the reuse of previous values using the `..` syntax
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        // --snip--

        let user2 = User {
            active: user1.active,
            username: user1.username,
            email: String::from("another@example.com"),
            sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
        };
        // vs.
        let user3 = User {
            email: String::from("another@example.com"),
            ..user1 // note, this won't compile because `user1` is already moved above.
        };
    }
    ```
- Tuple Structs
    Tuple strctus are useful when the whole tuple needs a name and it should be different than other tuple types.
    ```rust
    struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
    struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

    fn main() {
        let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
        let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
    }
    ```
- Unit-like Structs
    - Unit-like structs can be useful when you need to implement a trait on some type but donâ€™t have any data that you want to store in the type itself.

### Debugging Structs

- `#[derive(Debug)]` - prepended to a struct allows the values to be debug printed with the `println!` macro
    - debug printing uses `{:?}` or `{:#?}`, which changes the default formatting.
- `dbg!` macro
    - an alternative uses the `dbg!` mactro, which will take ownership of the expression
    - `println!` just takes a reference
    - This will also print the file, the line number, the resultant value of the expression, and returns ownership of the value
    - prints to `stderr`, but `println!` prints to `stdout`

### Method Syntax

- similar to functions
    - declared with the `fn` keyword and a name
    - can have parameters and a return value
    - contain code that is run
- defined in the context of a struct (or an enum or trait object)
    - first parameter is always `self`, which represents the kinstance of the struct the method is being called on
- `impl` (implementation) block allows defining the context where the method is defined
    - `&self` is shorthand for `self: &Self`, which in the `impl` block, `Self` is an alias for the type that the `impl` block is for.
    - may be abbreviated this with only the name `self` in the first parameter spot
    - Must still use `&` to indicate that this method borrows the `Self` instance and is immutable
- a _getter_ could be defined with a method to make the field private and the method public, to enable read-only access to that field

#### Associated Functions

- are not methods because they don't have `self` as the first parameter
    - e.g. `String::from`
    ```rust
    impl Rectangle {
        // creates a square without needing to define both the width and height
        fn square(size: u32) -> Self {
            Self {
                width: size,
                height: size,
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    - `Self` keyword in the return type are aliases for the type of the `impl` keyword
- `impl` blocks can be separated which could be useful for generic types and traits

## Enums and Pattern Matching

```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}

let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
```
- Any IP address can either be v4 or v6, but not both at the same time
- Allows functions to be defined to take either variant
    ```rust
    fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}
    ```
- rather than putting an enum into a struct, we can put data directly into each enum variant
    - the name of the enum variant also becomes a function that constructs an instance of the enum
    - variants can have different types and amounts of associated data
        e.g. IPv4 have four numeric components between 0 and 255, but we may still want IPv6 to be aa single string. 
- There is a [standard library for ip address encodings](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/enum.IpAddr.html)
- We could use structs to individually define variants, but it would be more difficult to define a function to take any of the types

### `Option` enum

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T),
}
```
- allows rust to avoid having a `null` value.
    - `None` is still better because using the `Option` type allows the compiler to check if the appropriate actions are implemented, which avoides the problem of assuming that something isn't null when it actually is.
- part of the standard library prelude
- Will need to get the value out of the `Option<T>` to use it
    - https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html

#### `match` control flow

- similar to a `switch/case` or a series of `if` conditions, but doesn't need to evaluate to a Boolean value
- e.g. coin sorter
- matches are exhaustive, so all "arms" must be covered
    - helps prevent forgetting to explicitly handle the `None` case for `Option<T>`.
- `match` has two catch-all patterns
    - `other` can cover all the remaining cases, when we want to use the value in the predicate arm
    - `_` can cover all the remaining cases, when we do NOT want to use the value in the predicate arm
        - prevents a wanring about an unused variable

### if let

```rust
let config_max = Some(3u8);
match config_max {
    Some(max) => println!("The maximum is configured to be {}", max),
    _ => (),
}

// vs

let config_max = Some(3u8);
if let Some(max) = config_max {
    println!("The maximum is configured to be {}", max);
}
```
- The `_ => ()` is just boilerplate if we're not doing anything with it, but switching to `if let` loses the exhaustive pattern matching
- can inclue an `else` statement to handle the cases for the catch-all too.
