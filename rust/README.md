# Learning Rust

## Getting Started

### Installation

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Installed the default installation, which includes `cargo`, `clippy`, `rust-std`, `rustc`, `rustfm`

- Metadata and toolchains installed into the Rustup home directory `/Users/michaelliu/.rustup` and can be modified with the `RUSTUP_HOME` environment variable
- commands added to Cargo's bin directory `/Users/michaelliu/.cargo/bin`
    - commands added to the PATH environment variable by modifying
        - `/Users/michaelliu/.profile`
        - `/Users/michaelliu/.zshenv`
- To configure your current shell, run: `source "$HOME/.cargo/env"`

### Cargo

- Initialize new projects
    ```shell
    cargo new <PROJECT_NAME>
    ```
- Build projects
    ```shell
    cargo run
    ```
- Run projects
    ```shell
    cargo run
    ```
- Install libraries by adding them to the Cargo.toml file under dependencies. e.g.
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    rand = "0.8.5"
    ```
- Cargo.lock ensures reproducible builds 
- Build documentation for all dependencies locally
    ```shell
    cargo doc --open
    ```

## Common Programming Concepts

### Variables and Mutability

- `let` allows the declaration of a immutable variable
- `let mut` allows the declaration of a mutable variable 
- `const` allows the declaration of a value that is allways immutable
    - the type _must_ be annotated
    - may only be set to a constant expression
        - cannot be set to a value that is computed at runtime
    - __BY CONVENTION__ - all uppercase with underscores between words
- shadowing variables
    - first variable is shadowed by the second and the second
    - repeated use of `let` and the same variable name
    - `let` is important because the variable is still immutable
    - shadowing allows the type of the variable can change
        ```rust
        // valid
        let spaces = "   "; // string
        let spaces = spaces.len(); // number

        // compile time error
        let mut spaces = "   "; // string
        spaces = spaces.len(); // number
        ```
        - avoids different names like `spaces_str` and `spaces_num`
