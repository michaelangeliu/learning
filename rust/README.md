    ```
- Install libraries by adding them to the Cargo.toml file under dependencies. e.g.
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    rand = "0.8.5"
    ```
- Cargo.lock ensures reproducible builds 
- Build documentation for all dependencies locally
    ```shell
    cargo doc --open
    ```

## Common Programming Concepts

### Variables and Mutability

- `let` allows the declaration of a immutable variable
- `let mut` allows the declaration of a mutable variable 
- `const` allows the declaration of a value that is allways immutable
    - the type _must_ be annotated
    - may only be set to a constant expression
        - cannot be set to a value that is computed at runtime
    - __BY CONVENTION__ - all uppercase with underscores between words
- shadowing variables
    - first variable is shadowed by the second and the second
    - repeated use of `let` and the same variable name
    - `let` is important because the variable is still immutable
    - shadowing allows the type of the variable can change
        ```rust
        // valid
        let spaces = "   "; // string
        let spaces = spaces.len(); // number

        // compile time error
        let mut spaces = "   "; // string
        spaces = spaces.len(); // number
        ```
        - avoids different names like `spaces_str` and `spaces_num`

### Data Types

#### Scalar

- Integer
    - signed/unsigned numbers in [two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement)
    - e.g. `i32`, `u32`
    - `isize` and `usize` depends on the archtecture the computer is running on
        - e.g. 64 bits if on a 64-bit archtecture
    - `i32` is a good default integer size generally
    - Can use `_` as a visual separator
        e.g. `1_000` is equivalent to `1000`
    - integer overflow can cause the program to panic
        - when debugging, the compiler will check
        - the `--release` flag will skip overflow checks and use _two's complement wrapping_
            - relying on wrapping is considered an error
        - Explicit handling by:
            - Wrap in all modes with the `wrapping_*` methods, such as `wrapping_add`.
            - Return the None value if there is overflow with the `checked_*` methods.
            - Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the `overflowing_*` methods.
            - Saturate at the valueâ€™s minimum or maximum values with the `saturating_*` methods.
- Floating-point
    - `f32` and `f64`
        `f32` is single-precision flooat
        `f64` is double-precision flooat
    - `f64` is default due to increased precision and the assumption that it's running on modern CPUs
    - IEEE-754 standard
- Numeric Operations
    - `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`,
    - integer division truncates toward zero to the nearest integer
        - e.g. (`-5/3 === -1` and `5/3 === 1`)
- Booleans
    - `bool` keyword
    - 1 byte in size
        i.e. `00000000` or `11111111`
- Characters
    - `char` keyword
    - 4 bytes
        - uses Unicode Scalar Values from `U+0000` to `U+D7FF` and `U+E000` to `U+10FFFF` inclusive
    - specified with single quotes, as opposed to double quotes, which use double quotes.

#### Compound Types

- Tuple
    - Group a number of values with a variety of types together
    - fixed length, cannot grow or shrink
    - comma-separated list of values inside parentheses
    - each position in the tuple has a type, but can be different
    - Can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value
        ```rust
        fn main() {
            let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

            let (x, y, z) = tup;

            println!("The value of y is: {y}");
        }
        ```
    - or with indexes
        ```rust
        fn main() {
            let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

            let five_hundred = x.0;

            let six_point_four = x.1;

            let one = x.2;
        }
        ```
    - _unit_ is a special name ofr a tuple without any values and represents an empty value or an empty return type
        - expresssions implicitly return the _unit_ vavlue if they dont' return any other value
- Array
    - collection of values with the same type
    - fixed length, cannot grow or shrink
    - comma separated list of values inside square brackets
    - stored in a stack, rather than a heap, in memory
    - examples
        ```rust
        let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // type can be specified like so:

        let b: [3; 5]; // equivalent to [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
        ```
    - access with squqare brackets and indexes
        - invalid index access will cause the app to panic

### Functions

- snake_case is the conventional style for function and variable names
- `fn` is the function definition keyword

#### Parameters

- special variables that are part of a function's signature
- `arguments` are the concrete values that are provided to a function
- function signatures require parameter type annotations to allow it to give a more helpful error message

#### Statements and Expressions

- function bodies are made up of a series of statements, optionally ending in an expression
    - __Statements__ are instructions that perform somea ction and do not return a value
    - __Expressions__ evaluate to a resultant value
        ```rust
        fn main() {
            let y = {
                let x = 3;
                x + 1
            };

            println!("The value of y is: {y}");
        }
        ```
        - Note the lack of a semicolon. Adding a semicolon to the end of an expression turns it into a statement and it will not return a value.

#### Functions with Return Values

- declare function return value type after an arrow (`->`).
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let x = plus_one(5);

        println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    }

    fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
        x + 1
    }
    ```
    vs.
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let x = plus_one(5);

        println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    }

    fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
        x + 1; // This semi-colon means its a statement and returns the unit type (), which contradicts the return value annotation
    }
    ```

### Comments

- `//` is the standard single line comment.
- Sometimes at the end of lines, but more typically used as annotation on a separate line above the code.

### Control Flow

#### `if` expressions

- start with `if` keyword, foollowed by an expression.
- blocks of code are placed in curly braces
    - sometimes called _arms_, like the `match`
- `else` is optional
- will not automatically try to convert non-Boolea types to a Boolean.
- multiple conditions with `else if`.
- `if` is an expression, so it can be used to assign variables (i.e. ternary assignment)
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let condition = true;
        let number i= if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

        println!("The value of number is: {number}");
    }
    ```
    - Since they are expressions, the return types cannot be mismatched, or else ther eis an error.

#### Repetition with Loops

- `loop`
    - repeats forever until quit
        - `ctrl-c` can quit
        - `break` will exit the loop
            - Including the value after the `break` will return that value from the loop
        - `continue` skips the remaining code to go to the next iteration
    - `break`/`continue`
        - applies to the inner most loop, if there are multiple
    - loops can be labeled which can be used with `break`/`continue`
        ```rust
        fn main() {
            let mut count = 0;
            'counting_up: loop {
                println!("count = {count}");
                let mut remaining = 10;

                loop {
                    println!("remaining = {remaining}");
                    if remaining == 9 {
                        break;
                    }
                    if count == 2 {
                        break 'counting_up;
                    }
                    remaining -= 1;
                }

                count += 1;
            }
            println!("End count = {count}");
        }
        ```
- `while`
    - Handles some of the nesting that would be necessary if you used `loop`, `if`, `else`, `break`.
- `for`
    - most commonly used for increase safety/conciseness.
    - can avoid an out of index exception when looping through arrays or for a certain number of times using `Range`
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
        let mut index = 0;

        while index < 5 { { // changing this to 6 would cause the code to panic when accessing a[6].
            println!("the value is {}", a[index]);

            index += 1;
        }}

        for number in (1..4).rev() {
            println!("{number}!");
        }
        println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
    }
    ```

## Understanding Ownership

### Stack & Heap memory

- Stack
    - LIFO = Last In, First Out
        - push & pop onto the stack
    - must have a known szie
- Heap
    - returns a pointer to the address of the allocated space
    - allocate/deallocate memory
- pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the allocator never has to search for a place to store new data.
- allocating space on the heap requires more work because the allocator must first find a big enough space to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next allocation.
- accessing data in the heap is slower than on the stack because you must follow a pointer

### Ownership Rules

- each value in Rust has an _owner_.
- there can only be one owner at a time.
when the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

### Variable Scope

#### The String Type

- allocated onto the heap
- can be created using a string literally using the `from` function
    ```rust
    let s = String::from("hello");
    ```
- When a variable goes out of scope, it will call a special function called `drop` to return the memory
    - In C++, this pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item's lifetime is sometimes called _Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)_.
- Simple vs. complex values
    ```rust
    let x = 5; // stores 5 into memory
    let y = x; // stores 5 into memory

    // vs.

    let s1 = String::from("hello"); // adds the meta-data/pointer and also stores the string contents
    let s2 = s1; // essentially copies the meta data, but does not copy the heap that the pointer refers to. Copying the heap memory could make it very expensive
    ```
    - a String is made of three parts
        - `ptr` = points at the memory that holds the string contents
        - `len` = length of the string
        - `capacity` = total space allocated
    - when `s2` and `s1` both go out of scope, both will try to free the same heap memory (_double free_ error).
    ```rust
        let s1 = String::from("hello");
        let s2 = s1;

        println!("{}, world!", s1); // compile error because Rust considers s1 no longer valid after the reassignment
    ```
- Rust will never automatically create "deep" copies of data, so _automatic_ copying is assumed to inexpensive
- `clone` will allow a "deep" copy
    ```rust
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone();

    println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);

    ```
- Rust has a special annotation called the `Copy` trait that we can place on types that are stored on the stack. If a type implements the `Copy` trait, variables that use it do not move, but rather are trivially copied, making them still valid after assignment to another variable.
    - If the type or any of its parts has implemented the `Drop` trait, it cannot be implemented with `Copy`
    - e.g.
        - integers
        - Booleans
        - floating points
        - chars
        - tuples if they only contain types that also implement `Copy`

#### Ownership and Functions

- Passing aa value to a function is similar to assigning a value to a variable
- will move/copy, just like an assignment
    - e.g.
        - passing a String will transfer ownership
        - passing an integer will make a copy
- returning the value will transfer ownership back if the value is assigned
- Could potentially be tedious by using tuples to return multiple values:
    - e.g. this scenario where we want to use both the string and the length
        ```rust
        fn main() {
            let s1 = String::from("hello");

            let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

            println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s2, len);
        }

        fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
            let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String

            (s, length)
        }
        ```
- _references_ allow using a value without transfering ownership

### References and Borrowing

- a reference is like a pointer that it's an address we can follow to access the data stored at that address; that data is owned by some other variable. Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type for the life of that reference
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let s1 = String::from("hello");

        let len = calculate_length(&s1);

        println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
    }

    fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
        s.len()
    }
    ```
    - no tuple code and they use `&` in both the argument and the function definition
        - `&` represents _references_, which allows values to be referenced without taking ownership of it.
- _borrowing_ = the act of creating a reference
- also immutable by default but we can create mutable references
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let mut s = String::from("hello");

        change(&mut s);
    }

    fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
        some_string.push_str(", world");
    }
    ```
    - cannot create multiple mutable __simultaneous__ references to a value
        - allows for mutation, but carefully
        - can prvent data races
            - e.g.
                - two or mre pointers access the same data at the same time
                - at least one of thpointers is being used towrite to the data
                - there's no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data
        - using a curly brace can create separate scopes to allow for multiple mutable references, just not _simultaneous_ ones
    - similar rule for combining mutable and immutable references

#### Dangling References

- _dangling pointer_ = pointer that references a location in memory that may have been given to someone else
```rust
fn dangle() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String

    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String

    &s // we return a reference to the String, s
} // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
  // Danger!
```
- Solution:
    ```rust
    fn no_dangle() -> String {
        let s = String::from("hello");

        s // return the string
    }
    ```

- The Rules of References
    - At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
    - References must always be valid.

### Slice Type

- A _string slice_ is a reference to part of a `String`
    ```rust
    let s = String::from("hello world");

    let hello = &s[0..5];
    let world = &s[6..11];
    ```
    - Just references a portion of a string using a starting and ending index
    - Ommitting the index means starting at either the beginning or end of the string
    - Avoids the value being freed when there are useless references to the size later.
- Swapping `&String` with `&str` increases the flexibility through _deref coercions_
    ```rust
    fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str { ... }
    // vs
    fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str { ... }
    ```
    - this is because `&str` is a slice pointing to a specific point of the binary data
- Arrays can also be sliced
    ```rust
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let slice = &a[1..3]; // type of &[i32]

    assert_eq!(slice, &[2, 3]);
    ```

## Structs

### Defining and Instantiating Structs

- Essentially JS objects
    ```rust
    struct User {
        active: bool,
        username: String,
        email: String,
        sign_in_count: u64,
    }

    // builds and returns a User struct with these properties. Reduces duplication of property names by using the same name as a shorthand
    fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
        User {
            active: true,
            username,
            email,
            sign_in_count: 1,
        }
    }
    ```
    - structs can be mutable, but the whole thing must be mutable to reassign any individual properties using dot notation.
- Struct update syntax allows the reuse of previous values using the `..` syntax
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        // --snip--

        let user2 = User {
            active: user1.active,
            username: user1.username,
            email: String::from("another@example.com"),
            sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
        };
        // vs.
        let user3 = User {
            email: String::from("another@example.com"),
            ..user1 // note, this won't compile because `user1` is already moved above.
        };
    }
    ```
- Tuple Structs
    Tuple strctus are useful when the whole tuple needs a name and it should be different than other tuple types.
    ```rust
    struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
    struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

    fn main() {
        let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
        let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
    }
    ```
- Unit-like Structs
    - Unit-like structs can be useful when you need to implement a trait on some type but donâ€™t have any data that you want to store in the type itself.

### Debugging Structs

- `#[derive(Debug)]` - prepended to a struct allows the values to be debug printed with the `println!` macro
    - debug printing uses `{:?}` or `{:#?}`, which changes the default formatting.
- `dbg!` macro
    - an alternative uses the `dbg!` mactro, which will take ownership of the expression
    - `println!` just takes a reference
    - This will also print the file, the line number, the resultant value of the expression, and returns ownership of the value
    - prints to `stderr`, but `println!` prints to `stdout`

### Method Syntax

- similar to functions
    - declared with the `fn` keyword and a name
    - can have parameters and a return value
    - contain code that is run
- defined in the context of a struct (or an enum or trait object)
    - first parameter is always `self`, which represents the kinstance of the struct the method is being called on
- `impl` (implementation) block allows defining the context where the method is defined
    - `&self` is shorthand for `self: &Self`, which in the `impl` block, `Self` is an alias for the type that the `impl` block is for.
    - may be abbreviated this with only the name `self` in the first parameter spot
    - Must still use `&` to indicate that this method borrows the `Self` instance and is immutable
- a _getter_ could be defined with a method to make the field private and the method public, to enable read-only access to that field

#### Associated Functions

- are not methods because they don't have `self` as the first parameter
    - e.g. `String::from`
    ```rust
    impl Rectangle {
        // creates a square without needing to define both the width and height
        fn square(size: u32) -> Self {
            Self {
                width: size,
                height: size,
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    - `Self` keyword in the return type are aliases for the type of the `impl` keyword
- `impl` blocks can be separated which could be useful for generic types and traits

## Enums and Pattern Matching

```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}

let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
```
- Any IP address can either be v4 or v6, but not both at the same time
- Allows functions to be defined to take either variant
    ```rust
    fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}
    ```
- rather than putting an enum into a struct, we can put data directly into each enum variant
    - the name of the enum variant also becomes a function that constructs an instance of the enum
    - variants can have different types and amounts of associated data
        e.g. IPv4 have four numeric components between 0 and 255, but we may still want IPv6 to be aa single string. 
- There is a [standard library for ip address encodings](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/enum.IpAddr.html)
- We could use structs to individually define variants, but it would be more difficult to define a function to take any of the types

### `Option` enum

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T),
}
```
- allows rust to avoid having a `null` value.
    - `None` is still better because using the `Option` type allows the compiler to check if the appropriate actions are implemented, which avoides the problem of assuming that something isn't null when it actually is.
- part of the standard library prelude
- Will need to get the value out of the `Option<T>` to use it
    - https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html

#### `match` control flow

- similar to a `switch/case` or a series of `if` conditions, but doesn't need to evaluate to a Boolean value
- e.g. coin sorter
- matches are exhaustive, so all "arms" must be covered
    - helps prevent forgetting to explicitly handle the `None` case for `Option<T>`.
- `match` has two catch-all patterns
    - `other` can cover all the remaining cases, when we want to use the value in the predicate arm
    - `_` can cover all the remaining cases, when we do NOT want to use the value in the predicate arm
        - prevents a wanring about an unused variable

### if let

```rust
let config_max = Some(3u8);
match config_max {
    Some(max) => println!("The maximum is configured to be {}", max),
    _ => (),
}

// vs

let config_max = Some(3u8);
if let Some(max) = config_max {
    println!("The maximum is configured to be {}", max);
}
```
- The `_ => ()` is just boilerplate if we're not doing anything with it, but switching to `if let` loses the exhaustive pattern matching
- can inclue an `else` statement to handle the cases for the catch-all too.

## Packages, Crates, and Modules

- __Packages__ = A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates
- __Crates__ = A tree of modules that produces a library or executable
- __Modules__ and __use__ = Let you contro the organization, scope, and privacy of paths
- __Paths__ = A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module

### Packages and Crates

- _crate_ = smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers at a time
- `rustc` considers the single file that is passed as a crate
- 2 forms
    - binary crate = programs compiled to an executable that can be run (CLI program or server)
        - must have a function called `main`
    - library crate = define functionality intended to be shared with multiple projects
        - references to "crate" usually mean a "library" crate
- _package_ = bundle orf one or more crates that provides a set of functionality
    - contains a _Cargo.toml_ file that describes how to build those crates
    - Cargo is actually a package
    - must contain at least one crate
        - many binary crates
        - only one library crate
    - __BY CONVENTION__ - _src/main.rs_ is the crate root of a binary crate
    - __BY CONVENTION__ - _src/lib.rs_ is the crate root for a library crate
    - may have multiple binary crates by placing files in the _src/bin_ directory

### Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy

- [Modules Cheat Sheet](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-02-defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy.html#modules-cheat-sheet)
    1. Start from the crate root (_src/lib.rs_ or _src/main.rs_)
    2. Declare modules - compiler looks for the modules code
        - e.g. a "garden" module could be declared with `mod garden;`. The compiler looks for the module's code
            - inline (by replacing the semicolon with curly brackets)
            - in the file _src/garden.rs_
            - in the file _src/garden/mod.rs_
                - This is an older style, but still supported (can be confusing to have many files named _mod.rs_)
    3. Declare sub modules - Therse are declared in the other files
        - e.g. a "vegetable" submodule could be declared with `mod vegetables;` in _src/garden.rs_. The compiler looks for the submodule's code
            - inline (by replacing the semicolon with curly brackets)
            - in the file _src/garden/vegetables.rs_
            - in the file _src/garden/vegetables/mod.rs_
                - This is an older style, but still supported (can be confusing to have many files named _mod.rs_)
    4. Paths to code in modules - once a module is part of your crate, you can refer to code in that module from anywhere else in the same crate as long as privacy rules allow
        - NOT the same as `include` in other languages because only needed once for the whole project. All references will refer to the loaded file's code
    5. Private vs public - code is private by default, but can be made public by using `pub mod`
    6. `use` keyword can create shortcuts to reduce repetition of long paths

### Paths for referring to an item in the Module Tree

- show where to find an iterm in a module tree
    - _absolute path_ = full path starting from a crate root
        - external crates start with the crate name
        - current crate starts with the literal `crate`
            - like using `/` to start from the filesystem root in your shell
    - _relative path_ starts from the current module and uses `self`, `super`, or an identifier in the current modules
- separate identifies with double colons (`::`)
- depends on whether you're more likely to move item definition code separately from or together with the code that uses the itme.
    - generally absolute path is preferred because it's more likely we'll want to move code definitions and item calls independently of each other.
- parents can't use private items in child modules, but child modules can use the items int heir ancestor modules
    - child modules wrap and hide their implementation details
    - defaulting to private and hiding inner implementaiton details lets you know which parts of the inner code you can change without breaking outer code.
- __BEST PRACTICE__ - packages can contain both _src/main.rs_ and _src/lib.rs_ with the package name by default. Packages containing both types of crates will typically have just enough code in the binary crate to start an executable that calls code with the lbirary crate. This allows other projects to benefit rom the most functionality that the package provides because the library crate's code cna be shared.
    - Module tree should be defined in the _src/lib.rs_, only public items can be used by the binary crate. So the binary crate is just another user of the library crate, just like a completely external crate would use the library crate.
- `super` allows construction of relative paths that begin in the parent module rather than the current module or crate root. (i.e. filesystem path with the `..` syntax)

#### Making Structs and Enums Public

- Structs - `pub` will only make the struct public, but the fields are still private.
- Enums - `pub` will make all of its variants public

### Bringing Paths into Scope with the `use` keyword

- `use` creates a shortucut to a path allowing the shorter name everywhere else in scope.
- similar to a symbolic link in the filesystem
- only a shortcut for the particular scope in which the `use` occurs
    - can't use the shortcut in child modules, etc.
- Creating Idiomatic `use` Paths
    - Bringing the functionâ€™s parent module into scope with use means we have to specify the parent module when calling the function. Specifying the parent module when calling the function makes it clear that the function isnâ€™t locally defined while still minimizing repetition of the full path.
    - For structs, enums, and other items, it's idiomatic to specify the full path.
- Creating new names with the `as` keyword
    - allows for changing the name when there are two types with the same name.
- Rexporting Names with `pub use`
    - brings item into scope, but also makes the item available for other sto bring into their scopee
    - useful when the internal structure of your code is different from how programmers calling your code would think about the domain.
        - we can write the code with one structure but expoes a different structure
        - makes our library organized for programmers working on the library and programmers calling the library
- External Packages
    - can be used by adding them to _Cargo.toml_
- Nested Paths
    - Can change
        ```rust
        // --snip--
        use std::cmp::Ordering;
        use std::io;
        // --snip--
        ```
        to
        ```rust
        // --snip--
        use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};
        // --snip--
        ```
    - or
        ```rust
        // --snip--
        use std::io;
        use std::io::Write;
        // --snip--
        ```
        to
        ```rust
        // --snip--
        use std::{self, Write};
        // --snip--
        ```
- Glob Operator
    - `*` brings all public items in a defined path into scope
    - be careful since it can make it harder to tell what names are in scope and where a name used in your program was defined
    - often used when testing or as part of the prelude pattern

## Common Collections

- most other data types represent one specific value, but collections can contain multiple values.
- unlike built-in array an dtuple types, the data these collections point to is stored on the heap,
    - means the amount of data does not need to be known at complie time and can grow or shrink as the program runs
- 3 often used collections
    - _vector_ = store a variable number of values next to each other.
    - _string_ = collection of characters
    - _hash map_ = assoiate a value with a particular key
        - specific implementation of a more general data structure called a _map_
    - [Other Collections](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/index.html)

### Storing Lists of Values with Vectors

- Create a new empty vector with `Vec::new` or `vec!`
    - `push` will add elements to the vector if it is mutable
- Read elements of vectors via indexing or the `get` method
    - Using indexing will cause the program to panic because it references a nonexistant element `let does_not_exist = &v[100];`
    - Using `get` returns an `Option`, so it can rreturn `None`
- Iterate through a vector using a `for-in` loop.
- Enum to store multiple types
    - Vectors can only store values that are the same type, so using an enum allows different types to be held
    - The compiler needs to know how much memory on the heap will be needed to store each element
    - Enum plus a `match` expression will ensure at compile time, every case is handled
        - traits can be used if the exhhaustive set of types is unknown
- Drop element 

### Storing UTF-8 ESncoded Text with Strings

- `str` is the only String type in the core language
    - usually seen in its borrowed form `&str`
- `String` is provided by Rust's standard library
    - gorwable, mutable, owned, UTF8-encoded
- `String` is a wrapper around a vector of bytes with some extra guarantees, restrictions, and capabilities
    - `to_string` method is available to any type that implements the `Display` trait
        - creates a `String` from a string literal
    - `from` creates a String from string literal
- Updating Strings
    - `push_str` to append a string slice
    - `push` to append a single character
    - `+` uses the `add` method
        ```rust
        fn add(self, s: &str) -> String {}
        ```
        - copiler coerces the `&String argument into a `&str`
    - `format!` macro for Multiple concatenations
- Indexing into Strings
    - `String` cannot be indexed by an integer because unicode scalar values may take more than one byte of storage
        - Strings can be viewed as bytes, scalar values, and grapheme clusters to allow for handling many different human languages
        - Not an O(1) operation because Rust would have to walk through the contents from the beginning to the index to determine valid characters
- Slicing Strings
    - Since it's not clear what the return type of the string indexing operation should be, Rust uses a a range to create a string slice containing particular bytes
    - if the slice only contains part of a characater's bytes, it will panic at runtime
- Methods for iterating over Strings
    - `chars` will return the separate characters
    - `bytes` will return each raw byte
        - Some valid Unicode scalar values may be made up of more than 1 byte
    - grapheme clusters are complex, so it's not included in the standard library
- other methods are built into the standard library
    - `contains` for searcdhing in a string
    - `replace` for substituting parts of a string

### Hash Maps

- `HashMap<K, V>` to store data with keys of tkype `K` and values of type `V`
    - not commonly used, so it is not included with the prelude
- Create with `new`
- Add elements with `insert`
- Access with `get`
    - can be iterated through with a `for` loop in an arbitrary order
- types that implement the `Copy` trait will be copied into the hasmap
- owned values will be moved and the hash map will be the owner of those values
    - inserting references to values into the hash map won't move the values, but the values must be valid for at least as long as the hash map is valid
- Updating has options, depending on the desired outcome
    - Overwrite the value by calling `insert` twice. Will only keep the latest insert.
    - Adding a key and value only if a key isn't present
        - `entry` is a special API which returns an enum called `Entry` that represents a value that might or might not exist.
        - `Entry::or_insert` is defined to return a mutable reference to the value for the corresponding `Entry` key if that key exists
    - Updating a value based on the old value
        - `Entry` returns a mutable reference, which can be dereferenced and modified
- Default hashing function is _SipHash_ for resistance to DoS attacks involving hash tables
    - more secure, but slightly slower, can be changed by using a different hashing function which implements the `BuildHasher` trait
